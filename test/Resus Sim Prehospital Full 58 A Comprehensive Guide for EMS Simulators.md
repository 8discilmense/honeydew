## What is Resus Sim Prehospital Full 58?
 
Resus Sim Prehospital Full 58 is a simulation training program that uses high-fidelity manikins, realistic environments, and expert feedback to provide you with a comprehensive and engaging learning experience. The program consists of 58 scenarios that cover the most common and challenging situations that you may encounter in prehospital emergency care. Each scenario has a specific learning objective, a detailed case description, and a debriefing session.
 
The scenarios are designed to test your knowledge, skills, and decision-making abilities in a safe and controlled environment. You will have to assess the patient's condition, perform the appropriate interventions, communicate effectively with your team and other services, and document your actions. You will also receive feedback from experienced instructors who will help you identify your strengths and areas for improvement.
  
## How does Resus Sim Prehospital Full 58 work?
 
Resus Sim Prehospital Full 58 is delivered online through a user-friendly platform that allows you to access the scenarios anytime and anywhere. You can choose to complete the scenarios individually or in groups, depending on your preference and availability. You can also customize the scenarios to suit your level of expertise and learning goals.
 
To start a scenario, you will need to log in to the platform and select the scenario that you want to do. You will then see a brief introduction that explains the learning objective, the case description, and the expected outcomes. You will also see a video that shows the simulated environment and the patient's presentation. You will then have to interact with the patient using voice commands or text inputs. The patient's responses and vital signs will change according to your actions. You will also have access to various tools and resources such as an ambulance dashboard, a monitor, a defibrillator, a drug box, and more.
 
At the end of the scenario, you will see a summary of your performance and a debriefing session. The summary will show you how well you met the learning objective, how long you took to complete the scenario, how many interventions you performed correctly or incorrectly, and how many critical errors you made. The debriefing session will provide you with constructive feedback from an instructor who will highlight your positive points and suggest areas for improvement. You will also have the opportunity to review your actions and reflect on your learning.
